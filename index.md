## About Me

I am currently a researcher of Baidu VIS. I received my B.S. & M.S. degree from Tongji University, School of Automotive Engineering.

Since 2024, I have been working at Department of Computer Vision Technology (VIS), Baidu Inc, working closely with [Kaisiyuan Wang](https://unibruce.github.io) and [Hang Zhou](https://hangz-nju-cuhk.github.io) and on both audio/video-driven high-fidelity and efficient human video synthesis techniques. Previously, I also had a pleasant work experience at Intelligent Driving Group (IDG), working on End-to-End(e2e) Autonomous Driving.

## Research Interests

My research interests include both human-centric (e.g., Human Video Synthesis and Co-speech Gesture Generation) and object-centric (e.g., Object-Compositional Implicit Scene Generation) topics. Previously, I also pushed research in End-to-End Autonomous Driving.
